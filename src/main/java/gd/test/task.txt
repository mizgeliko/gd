These are programming problems/algorithms or such. The output is a working program with unit tests as applicable.
Feel free to make assumptions as needed as long as the core problem is the same. (inputs can be hard coded, external
systems can be hard coded/stubbed etc). The objective is to solve the problem the most efficient way with the best
quality code. This will help measure the developers experience anx expertise in some aspects of programming/development
needed for this role.


Let me know if you have questions.

Given a list of products, represented in json as follows

[{productId: '1234', type: 'Shirt', category: 3, price: 40},

{productId: '2341', type: 'Pants', category: 3a, price: 15},

{productId: '123', type: 'Shoe', category: 1, price: 20},

{productId: '234', type: 'Socks', category: 1a, price: 5}]

Create a sorted list of product pairings by matching similar categories (example category 1 and 1a, 2 and 2a etc.

Output list should be presented in sorted sequence of total cost of pair.



Expected output:

[{{productId: '123', type: 'Shoe', category: 1, price: 20},

{productId: '234', type: 'Socks', category: 1a, price: 5}},

{{productId: '1234', type: 'Shirt', category: 3, price: 40},

{productId: '2341', type: 'Pants', category: 3a, price: 15}}]

Given a line of text print all unique words and duplicate words.

What would be the approach if the same has to be done for

-          a book?

-          For a bookshelf (10s of books)

-          For a library (1000s of books)

Given a stream (infinite array) of

{

 timestamp: <timestamp in seconds>,

 name: <some string>

 value: <a numeric value>

 tags: [<strings>]

}
